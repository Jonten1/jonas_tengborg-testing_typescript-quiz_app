# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Tests

I have a unit test. And a BDD test that plays a round.
For these I've used Cypress.

## `npm run test:cypress`

Runs the Cypress test.

## Design

I have tried to follow the DRY an YAGNI method much as possible.

## Diagram

You can find all the diagrams in the 'diagram' folder
